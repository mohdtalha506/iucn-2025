            Key government and civil society actors carry out coordinated
            measures for the protection and sustainable management of
            biodiversity and natural resources in the Selva Maya.

        <div className="pt-2 pb-4">
          <h4>&gt;&gt; CONTEXT</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The Selva Maya, which extends from Mexico’s southern border across
            Belize and into northern Guatemala, is Mesoamerica’s largest forest
            area. Its ecosystems, which range from dry forests to evergreen
            rainforests, are home to an extraordinary diversity of endemic
            species, some of which are endangered. Of the 100,000 km2 of forest,
            more than 42,000 km2 are now in a protected area, of which there are
            over 19 in different categories that apply various governance models
            (ranging from national parks to biosphere reserves). <br />
            <br />
            The region was inhabited by the Mayas more than a thousand years
            ago, which is why many important historical and cultural sites can
            be found here. Today the forest is under enormous pressure due to
            the fact that it is inhabited by some 600,000 people, who belong to
            a wide variety of ethnic groups. Population growth and the
            increasing demand for agricultural produce are causing the
            agricultural frontier to advance (extensive grazing practised by
            large-scale farmers, as well as small-scale agriculture and
            livestock farming by the local population, most of whom are poor).
            Forest fires, illegal logging, trade in flora and fauna,
            unsustainable agriculture and oil production are interfering with
            ecosystems and protected areas, and the forest is becoming
            increasingly fragmented. Moreover, the impacts of climate change are
            now palpable. These include longer dry seasons and fewer watering
            points for animals.

          <h4>&gt;&gt; CHALLENGES</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            Responsibility for protection of the forest and the sustainable
            development of the Selva Maya region rests with the three countries
            concerned and their respective government agencies for protected
            area management, along with other public authorities such as those
            concerned with forestry and agriculture. Other actors operating in
            the region include various institutions such as local governments
            and non-governmental and civil society organisations. <br />
            <br />
            The actors in the region share a sound understanding of the
            protection goals and rules governing forest use in the protected
            areas themselves. Outside the region, on the other hand, views often
            vary widely. Various rules apply for instance to the use of
            transition zones, ranging from large-scale maize plantations to
            sustainable agriculture practised on small plots. Similarly, outside
            the protected areas there is often a lack of certainty regarding
            land use rights. In conjunction with pronounced social inequality
            this leads to conflicts within the rural population. Consequently,
            in most cases pressure on the protected areas comes from outside.{" "}
            <br /> <br />
            The protected area authorities lack the human and financial
            capacities to develop and effectively implement protective measures.
            Constant cuts in funding create difficulties, particularly with
            regard to fighting forest fires. At the national level, sector
            ministries do not possess sufficient operational capabilities for
            inter-sectoral coordination and consultation, and policies and
            programmes often conflict with each other. At the regional level
            there is a lack of joint strategies for coordinated protection of
            the Selva Maya, hence activities are often confined to single
            countries and one-off interventions. There is also a lack of legal
            frameworks for cross-border cooperation in protected area
            management. The key challenge for long-term sustainable natural
            resource management in the Selva Maya is therefore coordination of
            the key governmental and civil society actors.

        <div className="pt-2 pb-4">
          <h4>&gt;&gt; APPROACH</h4>

          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The project is gradually implementing a multi-level approach. Key to
            its success is close coordination between the different levels and
            within the project team. <br />
            <br /> When the project was launched it focused initially on the
            micro level. By implementing specific local measures, it succeeded
            in building trust and openness, among both the local population and
            protected area staff. Gradually it then became possible to organise
            knowledge transfer by building horizontal links between protected
            area managers and user groups from the three countries, for
            instance, and to scale-up the project activities. A common
            denominator of this kind is key to performing any kind of work on a
            tri-national level.
            <h6 className="text-center pt-4">
              &gt; SUSTAINABLE INCOME-GENERATING ALTERNATIVES
            </h6>
            <div className="container p-4 py-2">
              Working in conjunction with the local population, the project
              developed various options for sustainable natural resource
              management. Where there is no local population, or where local
              communities are unable to generate a profit from sustainable
              forest management, illegal loggers for instance or people seeking
              quick profits will have an easy time of it. <br />
              <br />
              <b>An example – Honey and ramon nuts</b>
              <br />
              The project supported the development of local user group
              capacities to sustainably manage non-wood forest products, such as
              honey and ramon nuts (also known as Maya nuts), the promotion of
              value chains and certification of products. Supported by the
              project, over 750 people have acquired knowledge and skills in the
              fields of processing, food hygiene, accounting and marketing,
              which will enable them to work in small enterprises and generate
              added value from forest conservation. Over 3,000 families are
              benefiting from this. <br />
              <br />
              The honey producers around one of the protected areas have become
              part of a volunteer fire department for this protected area, and
              thus have multidimensional links. On the one hand, they support
              the protected area authority with monitoring, control and forest
              fire-fighting activities. On the other hand, they benefit from the
              existence of the forest through their beekeeping activities.

              <br />
              <b>An example – Forest concessions for local communities</b>
              In the community forest concessions in the biosphere reserve in
              Guatemala, the different communities are permitted to sustainably
              manage wood and non-wood forest products (leaves for the flower
              market, chicle, ramon nuts etc.)– albeit subject to tight
              restrictions and on the basis of management plans. Among other
              things, the project is advising on the ramon nut value chain and
              on management of the concessions. <br />
              <br />
              <h6 className="text-center">
                &gt; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE IN THE SELVA MAYA REGION
              </h6>
              <div className="container p-4 py-2">
                Without joint efforts by all stakeholders, long-term protection
                of the Selva Maya is inconceivable. To achieve this,
                coordination mechanisms must be introduced at the local,
                regional and international levels. <br />
                <br />
                Cross-border cooperation between park rangers (exchange, joint
                activities, training, patrols etc.) and exchange between user
                groups (honey, ramon nuts etc.) has led to a sense of
                commonality and what might be termed ‘corporate branding’ ({" "}
                <a href="https://selvamaya.info/en/selva-maya-main/" target="_blank">
                  <span style={{ color: "Aqua" }}>'We are Selva Maya’</span>
                </a>{" "}
                ), which has paved the way for improved coordination across the
                three countries. This led to coordination among the directors of
                the protected areas, who then joined forces to form the
                tri-national Selva Maya operational coordination group (Grupo
                Operativo de Coordinación de la Selva Maya – GOC). To also
                strengthen transboundary cooperation at the strategic level the
                tri-national Grupo Estratégico de Cooperación de la Selva Maya
                (GEC) was established, in which the directors of the nature
                conservation authorities of the three countries intend to
                develop a long-term strategy to protect the Selva Maya, for
                example.

          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            <ul>
              <li className="p-1">
                A multi-level approach and a bottom-up structure for regional
                cooperation are key to transboundary protection. Local actors
                can then feed successful activities upwards to the next level,
                which means they can always be scaled up. This also reduces
                dependency on personnel changes at higher political levels, e.g.
                as a result of elections.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                To support this approach, it is important that the project
                maintains a presence in all three countries (through the project
                offices) at locations close to the protected areas and the
                relevant public agencies. This makes implementation more
                efficient and effective compared to management from central
                locations (capital city, or only one project office).
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                It is also important here that the lessons learned from work at
                the local level are fed into country-wide work by the national
                experts. Closely linking these three levels gives the project
                credibility and weight at the tri-national level.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                The three countries that share the Selva Maya differ widely, as
                do their institutions. The project therefore had to address the
                different needs in order to gradually win over the stakeholders
                for transboundary cooperation. This meant that different
                activities were often supported in each of the countries, and
                that the project pursued different ways of working with partners
                with regard to planning and joint implementation. Accordingly,
                few tri-national activities took place, particularly in the
                initial years
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                It is also important to involve remote villages in regional
                cooperation, for instance by sharing lessons learned (e.g.
                organising reciprocal visits by farmers so that they can share
                their experience with marketing honey or nuts).
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                Protection strategies that support sustainable management
                increase the self-interest factor of relevant actors, thus
                making them more willing to participate in them.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                Developing a joint understanding of environmental conditions and
                the protection goals is a key factor for success.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                It is also important to establish sound management structures
                that enable effective joint work. Although a lot of the work is
                done on a voluntary basis a minimum budget is required, which is
                not always available in all cases.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                Acceptance and ownership in communities is strengthened by
                giving them strong rights of codetermination, either through
                co-management (as in the case of fighting forest fires) or
                autonomous management (as in the case of forest concessions).
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                It is important to facilitate a change in mindset among all
                stakeholders so that they see the government not as a body that
                issues prohibitions (for instance by designating a protected
                area), but one that creates opportunities to generate income
                sustainably. This will create a positive link between people and
                the natural environment, and make them willing to work to
                preserve it.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                Through their local knowledge and information sharing, motivated
                park rangers who tackle the challenges jointly with their peers
                help develop an effective protection strategy.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                When different projects in the same region work together with
                the same partners on the same topics, it is important to involve
                the partners in joint planning early on in order to persuade
                them of the benefits of effective coordination so that they
                provide the proactive support needed for cooperation.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                In order to protect the forest in the long term, it will be very
                important to ensure that the concessions, which people will have
                to reapply for in the future, remain at the local level. Forest
                concessionaires who come from outside often have no vested
                interest in preserving the forest in the long term.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                A formalisation of cooperation at the tri-national level, e.g.
                through an agreement, would boost the sustainability of the
                activities supported by the project, and strengthen future
                cooperation.
